# Google

A Google search clone made with [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

This project features a **responsive design**, **react server-side rendering (SSR)**, and **pagination**.

To display search results, [**Google's Custom Search JSON API**](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key) and [**Google's Custom Search Engine**](https://cse.google.com/) are used.

Icons provided by [**Heroicons**](https://heroicons.com/).

## Getting Started

First, create an API key (`API_KEY`) and Custom Search Engine key (`CONTEXT_KEY`).

Then, run the development server for building locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
